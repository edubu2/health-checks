# health-checks
Scripts that check the health of my computers.

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks.

The health_checks.py file combines all checks into one script and tells you if your computer has a problem.

This script will print "Everything ok" if all checks pass,
or the corresponding error messages if some checks fail.
